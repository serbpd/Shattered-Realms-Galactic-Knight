Shattered Realms: Galactic Knight
by Paul Serb, Kerry Peay, Justin Henry

Use WASD to move your character, and aim with the mouse. Click the left
mouse button to shoot and use the 1, 2, and 3 keys to switch between
weapons once they are aquired. Defeat all enemies in a room to open
the doors and proceed to another room. Explore the map to find new
weapons and prepare for the final boss.

Don't get hit by enemies or their attacks, and pick up health packs
to restore your health.
